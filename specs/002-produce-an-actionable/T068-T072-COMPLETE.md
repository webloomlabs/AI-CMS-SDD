## Files Created

1. `/frontend/src/services/media.ts` - 145 lines
2. `/frontend/src/components/MediaGrid.tsx` - 156 lines
3. `/frontend/src/components/MediaLibrary.tsx` - 272 lines

## Files Modified

   - Added image field type support
   - Added media selection handlers

---

## Dependencies

### Frontend Packages (Already Installed)
- React 18+
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- shadcn/ui components

### Backend APIs Used
- POST `/api/v1/media/upload` - Upload media
- GET `/api/v1/media` - List media
- GET `/api/v1/media/:id` - Get media
- DELETE `/api/v1/media/:id` - Delete media
- POST `/api/v1/content/:id/media` - Attach media
- GET `/api/v1/content/:id/media` - Get content media

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. ✅ Open ContentEditor and create new content
2. ✅ Select content type with image field
3. ✅ Click "Select Image" button
4. ✅ Upload new image via drag-and-drop
5. ✅ Upload new image via file browser
6. ✅ Select existing image from grid
7. ✅ Delete image from library
8. ✅ Verify image ID saved in content
9. ✅ Test responsive layouts
10. ✅ Test dark mode

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Component tests for MediaLibrary
- Component tests for MediaGrid  
- Service tests for media.ts
- Integration tests for upload flow
- E2E tests for content creation with media

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Multi-select**: Currently selects only first item in multi-select mode
   - Future: Update interface to support multiple media selections

2. **Image Preview**: Shows media ID instead of thumbnail in ContentEditor
   - Future: Add thumbnail preview with media URL

3. **Folder Support**: Folder structure not fully implemented in UI
   - Backend supports folderId but UI shows flat list

4. **Progress Tracking**: No percentage progress during upload
   - Future: Add upload progress bar

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Part of T073-T081)
- T073-T076: AI Integration UI
- T077-T081: Polish & Testing

### Future Enhancements
- Thumbnail generation preview
- Batch upload progress
- Image editing capabilities
- Folder organization UI
- Search and filter improvements
- CDN integration for media delivery
