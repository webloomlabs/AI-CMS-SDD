# T017 & T018 Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Tasks Completed**: T017, T018  
**Status**: ✅ RED Phase Complete (Tests Failing as Expected)

---

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ T017: Unit Tests for Content Service
**File**: `backend/tests/unit/content.test.ts`  
**Status**: Created and failing (as expected)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `createContent()` - Create content with fields
- ✅ `createContent()` - Handle multiple fields
- ✅ `getContent()` - Return content by ID with fields
- ✅ `getContent()` - Return null for non-existent content
- ✅ `listContent()` - Return all content items
- ✅ `listContent()` - Filter by contentTypeId
- ✅ `listContent()` - Filter by status
- ✅ `listContent()` - Filter by both contentTypeId and status
- ✅ `updateContent()` - Update content item
- ✅ `updateContent()` - Handle field updates
- ✅ `deleteContent()` - Delete content item
- ✅ `deleteContent()` - Throw error for non-existent content
- ✅ `generateSlug()` - Generate slug from title
- ✅ `generateSlug()` - Handle special characters
- ✅ `generateSlug()` - Append number if slug exists
- ✅ `generateSlug()` - Increment until unique slug found
- ✅ `generateSlug()` - Handle empty title
- ✅ `generateSlug()` - Trim leading/trailing hyphens

**Total Unit Tests**: 18 tests

**Result**: ❌ Test suite fails (expected - service not implemented yet)
```
Cannot find module '../../src/services/content'
```

---

### ✅ T018: Integration Tests for Content Endpoints
**File**: `backend/tests/integration/content.test.ts`  
**Status**: Created and failing (as expected)

**Test Coverage**:

#### POST /api/v1/content
- ✅ Should create content item with fields
- ✅ Should auto-generate slug if not provided
- ✅ Should require authentication
- ✅ Should validate required fields
- ✅ Should validate title is not empty
- ✅ Should validate status is draft or published
- ✅ Should validate fields is an array
- ✅ Should validate field structure

#### GET /api/v1/content
- ✅ Should list all content items
- ✅ Should filter by contentTypeId
- ✅ Should filter by status
- ✅ Should filter by both contentTypeId and status
- ✅ Should require authentication
- ✅ Should validate contentTypeId is an integer
- ✅ Should validate status is valid

#### GET /api/v1/content/:id
- ✅ Should get content by id with fields
- ✅ Should return 404 for non-existent content
- ✅ Should require authentication
- ✅ Should validate id is an integer

#### PUT /api/v1/content/:id
- ✅ Should update content item
- ✅ Should update content fields
- ✅ Should return 404 for non-existent content
- ✅ Should require authentication
- ✅ Should validate id is an integer
- ✅ Should validate status if provided
- ✅ Should validate fields if provided

#### DELETE /api/v1/content/:id
- ✅ Should delete content item
- ✅ Should cascade delete fields
- ✅ Should return 404 for non-existent content
- ✅ Should require authentication
- ✅ Should validate id is an integer

#### End-to-End Workflow
- ✅ Should support full CRUD lifecycle

**Total Integration Tests**: 32 tests (29 failed, 3 passed)

**Result**: ❌ Tests fail with 404 (expected - endpoints not implemented yet)

---

## Test Results

```bash
Test Suites: 2 failed, 2 total
Tests:       29 failed, 3 passed, 32 total
```

**Expected Failures**:
- Unit tests fail: `ContentService` module doesn't exist
- Integration tests fail: Content endpoints return 404 (not wired to Express yet)

**This is correct TDD behavior** - we write failing tests first (RED), then implement code to make them pass (GREEN).

## What Was Created

### 1. Unit Test File
```
backend/tests/unit/content.test.ts (548 lines)
```
- Comprehensive mocking of Prisma client
- Tests for all CRUD operations
- Tests for slug generation logic
- Edge cases covered

### 2. Integration Test File
```
backend/tests/integration/content.test.ts (528 lines)
```
- End-to-end API testing with real database
- Authentication testing
- Validation testing
- Full CRUD lifecycle test

## Next Steps (Remaining Day 2 Tasks)

Now that tests are written and failing, proceed to implementation:

### T019: Content Service Implementation
**File**: `backend/src/services/content.ts`  
**Goal**: Make unit tests pass (GREEN phase)

**Implementation Required**:
- `ContentService` class
- `createContent()` method
- `getContent()` method
- `listContent()` method with filters
- `updateContent()` method
- `deleteContent()` method
- `generateSlug()` method with uniqueness check

### T020: Content Controller Implementation
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/content.ts`  
**Goal**: Make integration tests pass (GREEN phase)

**Implementation Required**:
- Express route handlers for all endpoints
- Validation middleware
- Error handling
- Response formatting

### T021: Validation Middleware
**File**: `backend/src/middleware/validation.ts`  
**Goal**: Reusable validation helpers

### T022: Wire Routes to Express
**File**: `backend/src/index.ts`  
**Goal**: Connect content endpoints to the app

### T023: Seed Sample Content
**File**: `backend/prisma/seed.ts`  
**Goal**: Add sample articles for testing

---

## Verification Commands

### Run Unit Tests Only
```bash
cd backend && npm test -- unit/content.test.ts
```

### Run Integration Tests Only
```bash
cd backend && npm test -- integration/content.test.ts
```

### Run All Content Tests
```bash
cd backend && npm test -- content.test.ts
```

## TDD Progress

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **RED** | ✅ Complete | Tests written and failing |
| **GREEN** | ⏳ Next | Implement code to pass tests |
| **REFACTOR** | ⏳ After GREEN | Optimize and clean up |
